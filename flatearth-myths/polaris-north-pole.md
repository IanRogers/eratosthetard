# Polaris is the one and only magnetic source

Did you seriously miss out on science/engineering class a school? How do you think a coil magnet in an electric motor works? How about those toy magnets you could buy in shops? Look up "magnets for kids" in Amazon - are they fake? Is Amazon in on the hoax too? Or do you not believe in magnets (are you Mormon)? The needle in a compass is a magnet which lines up with the earth's field. Look up any of those "magnetic stick" toys in Amazon - they're labelled as "educational"...

Look up the phrase "Magnetic Monopole" in any source you like. If you can prove Polaris is one then you'll win several Nobel prizes, I'm not kidding.ï»¿
