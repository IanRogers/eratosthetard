# the earth supposedly spins so fast that we would be flung off of it like water spinning out of a fast spinning  wet tennis ball

No. It. Doesn't.

This is a basic error of maths that only flatheads make (and make over and over again despite being corrected). 
The correct term for this "gforce" is centripetal (or its confusing opposite, centrifugal). 
The force gets larger the faster something spins and the smaller the radius. This is why the cyclone thingies in 
dyson vacuum cleaners are pretty small. 

The earth's radius on the other hand is *huge* and spins very slowly - the 1,000mph figure is due to the earth turning 
only once in 24 hours and having a circumference around the equator of 24,901 miles; approx 24 thousand miles in 24 
hours is 1,000mph. There is a small centripetal force due to this and a bunch of resources out there to show you the 
equations (four times pi squared times the radius divided by the period of rotation squared) and calculate it for the 
earth - you weigh about 0.5% less at the equator than at the poles.
