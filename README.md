Critical thinking on the zetetic flat earth

Flat Earthers have a habit using insults rather than provide answers. They include:

- Nasshole
- Globetard
- Doofus

etc. It's just noise though, treat it like static on the line and carry on asking questions like:

- Was [Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Measurement_of_the_Earth.27s_circumference) funded by the Nasa conspiracy in 250BCE?

So I will accept one insult: I'm an Eratosthetard and proud of it.

# Questions the Flat Earthers need to answer

1. When you jump up why do you come back down again?

1. Why are the stars visible from the southern hemisphere completely different from the ones visible from the northern? Why can't you see Sigma Octantis from the northern hemisphere or Polaris from the south?

1. Where is the South Pole on the FE map? Melbourne is 3,613 miles from the south pole, Puntas Arenas is 2,554 miles, King Edward Point is 2,476 miles and Cape Town is 3,882 miles.  Can you draw a FE map consistent with those measurements or are the governments of Australia, Chile, UK and South Africa also part of the conspiracy?

1. How do you explain Stellar Parallax? Or is Harvard University also part of the conspiracy reporting a discovery from 1838 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1838MNRAS...4..152B ?

1. The sun is too bright to look at with the naked eye, but have a look at the moon - if it's moving around a flat earth why is is still pretty much the same size when it drops below the horizon rather than getting smaller and smaller?

1. If a globe moon is circling above a flat earth, how can it be that only the one side of the moon is visible no matter where on the disk you are? If the moon is a disk too then why doesn't it look foreshortened/eliptical as in moves about? And why does it look upside down from the southern hemisphere?

1. On a suposed flat earth, what force acts on the Sun to change its angular momentum so it moves in a spiral? Or a circle for that matter?

1. Why do the bottom of boats and towers at a distance disappear below the horizon before their tops?

1. Why aren't any of the other astronomical bodies flat too?

1. If it is all a big conspiracy by Nasa, are the Russian and Chinese space agencies in on it too? Or maybe, is it that the Russians or Chinese have completely infiltrated Nasa just to dupe the West? Was Neil Armstrong (an officer in the U.S Air Force) Chinese in fact?

1. Who benefits from this conspiracy? It would cost trillions to maintain, what do they gain?
