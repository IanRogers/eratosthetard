Critical thinking on the delusions of the flat earth

# Questions the Flat Earthers need to answer

1. When you jump up why do you come back down again?

1. Why are the stars visible from the southern hemisphere completely different from the ones visible from the northern? 

1. Where is the South Pole on the FE map? Melbourne is 3,613 miles from the south pole, Puntas Arenas is 2,554 miles, King Edward Point is 2,476 miles and Cape Town is 3,882 miles.  Can you draw a FE map consistent with those measurements or are the governments of Australia, Chile, UK and South Africa also part of the conspiracy?

1. How do you explain Stellar Parallax? Or is Harvard University also part of the conspiracy reporting a discovery from 1838 http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1838MNRAS...4..152B
